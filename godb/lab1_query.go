/*
computeFieldSum should (1) load the csv file named fileName into a heap file
(see [HeapFile.LoadFromCSV]), (2) compute the sum of the integer field named
sumField string and, (3) return its value as an int.

The supplied csv file is comma delimited and has a header.

If the file doesn't exist, can't be opened, the field doesn't exist, or the
field is not an integer, you should return an error.

Note that when you create a HeapFile, you will need to supply a file name;
you can supply a non-existant file, in which case it will be created.
However, subsequent invocations of this method will result in tuples being
reinserted into this file unless you delete (e.g., with [os.Remove] it before
calling NewHeapFile.

Note that you should NOT pass fileName into NewHeapFile -- fileName is a CSV
file that you should call LoadFromCSV on.
